# ATP-Sets-Prediction
Prediction models made in python with the goal of predicting the number of sets in ATP matches.

This project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the number of sets in ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) matches specifically in China. By leveraging historical data, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to provide valuable insights and predictions to tennis enthusiasts, sports analysts, and betting enthusiasts. Through this project, I aim to enhance understanding and improve decision-making in the world of professional tennis, specifically focusing on matches played in China.
