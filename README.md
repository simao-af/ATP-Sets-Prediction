# ATP-Sets-Prediction
Prediction models made in Python to predict the number of sets in ATP matches.

This project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the number of sets in ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) matches specifically in China. By leveraging historical data, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to provide valuable insights and predictions to tennis enthusiasts, sports analysts, and betting enthusiasts. Through this project, I aim to enhance understanding and improve decision-making in the world of professional tennis, specifically focusing on matches played in China.

## Data

The data used for this project will not be available here, but it was extracted using webscapping from the ATP website (https://www.atptour.com/).
For better visualization, it's better to use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab since this project was made with those interfaces.

The database had the following variables:
- PlayerName
- Born
- Height
- Hand
- LinkPlayer
- Tournament
- Location
- Date
- Ground
- Prize
- GameRound
- GameRank
- Oponent
- WL
- Score

## Report
There is also a report (written in portuguese) of the project, named Grupo9-PACDI.

This report aims to show the problem that was being studied and the respective data used, address the most relevant aspects of the decisions made, as well as describe the experiences and tests conducted, taking into account the development and test environments used.

In this regard, the dataset we will be working with pertains to ATP Players, encompassing all individual matches of 10,361 male professional tennis players (top 500 players who played between March 28, 1973, and February 14, 2022).

The development of our work follows the CRISP-DM methodology, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It provides an overview of the data lifecycle, aiming to gain deeper knowledge through data cleaning, preparation, exploration, and visualization.
CRISP-DM can be executed in a non-strict manner (moving forward and backward between different phases). By definition, this methodology consists of six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.
